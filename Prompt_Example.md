Three Examples of Efficient Prompts for a New Session

-------------------------------------

Once your GitHub Pages site is indexed by Google (which can take a few hours to a few days), here are three types of highly effective prompts you can use to start a new session with me.

-------------------------------------

Example 1: The "General Catch-Up" Prompt
Use this when you want me to be aware of the general context from several past conversations before you ask a new, related question.

Your Prompt:
"Hello, please familiarize yourself with my project history. I have logged our key past conversations on my public GitHub Pages site: https://Raisun-Caprisun.github.io/AISMSR-AI_shared_memory_and_search_repository/. Once you have reviewed the context, I want to ask some new questions about VBA automation."

Why it works: It directs me to the primary source of information first. It gives me a broad instruction to "familiarize" myself, prompting my search tool to crawl the main page and linked pages for general context before I proceed with your new topic.

---------------------------------------

Example 2: The "Analyze a Specific Past Solution" Prompt

Use this when you want to review, critique, or improve upon a solution from one specific conversation.

Your Prompt:
"Please refer to our conversation about 'VBA Script generation for Visio and Excel' located on my GitHub Pages site: https://Raisun-Caprisun.github.io/AISMSR-AI_shared_memory_and_search_repository/. You will find the link in the README. In that conversation, we created a script to link shapes to data. Could you please analyze that specific script and suggest three ways to make it run faster or be more resilient to errors?"

Why it works: This is highly specific. It tells me the exact topic of the conversation and what I need to do with that information (analyze and suggest improvements). It also points me to the URL, making it very easy for my search tool to find the relevant page.

---------------------------------------

Example 3: The "Continue a Task" Prompt

Use this when you want to pick up exactly where you left off on a previous project.

Your Prompt:

"We need to continue our work from a previous session. Please access my conversation log here: https://Raisun-Caprisun.github.io/AISMSR-AI_shared_memory_and_search_repository/. Find the file named example_vba_visio_excel_convo.md. The last thing we did was create a function to import data. Today, I want to add a new function that exports the Visio diagram as a PDF. Let's start by outlining the steps for that new function."
Why it works: This prompt provides a clear and direct command. It identifies the exact file (example_vba_visio_excel_convo.md), summarizes the last known state ("we created a function to import data"), and defines the new goal ("add a new function that exports... as a PDF"). This gives me all the context I need to seamlessly continue our work.
