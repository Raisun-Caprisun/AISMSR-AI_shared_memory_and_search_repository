# AI Shared Memory & Search Repository

**Disclaimer:** Collection of my personal queries regarding various projects - I am a broke cunt and I do not have money to pay Pro versions of AI clients, and until and when Google AI Studio cuts down the Token limit, I will use this as a learning box for it to read through and understand what I want from it.

This is a collection of my personal queries and conversations with AI assistants.

## The "Full Project Onboarding" Prompt
**Your Prompt (example with Crossdeck workload based layout optimization):**

"Hello Gemini. My GitHub Pages site, which documents my 'Crossdeck workload based layout optimization' project, should now be indexed and accessible to you.

Your task is to perform a complete analysis of this project.
Please start at my main site URL: https://raisun-caprisun.github.io/AISMSR-AI_shared_memory_and_search_repository/

From there, navigate to the "Crossdeck" project. Review its main README.md file, and then explore the contents of its /Excel/ and /Visio/ subfolders.

After reviewing all the available .md, .bas, .cls, and .txt files, please provide a comprehensive summary answering the following questions:

* High-Level Purpose: In simple terms, what problem does this entire project solve?

* Workflow & Data Flow: Describe the step-by-step process a user would follow. How does data move from the Excel components to the Visio components?

* Core Logic Breakdown: Based on the file names and your analysis, explain the key calculations. What is the difference between the "Euclidean" and "Manhattan" modules, and what role do the RectangleDef and ZoneDef classes play?

* Final Output: What is the ultimate result or deliverable that a user gets from this tool?

Essentially, I want you to explain my own project back to me as if you were a new developer who has just studied all the documentation and code."

**Why This Prompt is So Effective:**

* Sets a Clear Goal: "Perform a complete analysis of this project."

* Provides a Starting Point: It gives the exact URL to begin the search.

* Defines the Scope: It tells me to look at a specific project and explore all relevant file types within its subfolders.

* Structures the Output: The numbered questions give me a clear template for my response, ensuring I cover all the points you're interested in (Purpose, Workflow, Logic, and Output).

* Sets the Persona: The final sentence ("explain my own project back to me...") is a powerful instruction that tells me the desired tone and depth of the analysis. It pushes me beyond a simple summary to a more insightful explanation.
