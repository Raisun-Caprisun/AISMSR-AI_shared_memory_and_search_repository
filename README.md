# AI Shared Memory & Search Repository

**Disclaimer:** Collection of my personal queries regarding various projects - I am a broke cunt and I do not have money to pay Pro versions of AI clients, and until and when Google AI Studio cuts down the Token limit, I will use this as a learning box for it to read through and understand what I want from it.

This is a collection of my personal queries and conversations with AI assistants.
